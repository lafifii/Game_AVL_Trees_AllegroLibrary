# TF_AED
Game made on C++ using Allegro 5 Library using AVL trees as maps for the game and search metod among different scenarios. Since at the beggining of the game there are a million of different scenarios with different attributes and searching among them will make O(n) time complexity with any linear search,AVL trees are used for the searching time to be decreased to O(logn)
